# Project 1 readme
The only web browser i use is google chrome as it is what im most
familiar with. A browser is what we use to access the internet, it translates web languages for us into what the author of the sites
inteded them to look like based on the code they use.

I chose to visit ESPNs website from the year 2000 and compare it to now.
Its amazing how much it has changed! Back then there was very little variation in font type or font size and now it all looks much more organized and appealing to look at. It was funny because the screenshot i viewed had a headline about the first subway series since 1956. Which means the New York Yankees and Mets were going to be playing eachother in the world series which is something i have always been interested in seeing.

I found making the site for this first week to be way more simple than the coding i am used to. I have previously worked in javascript and never in html before this course. I really like the way html is organized and presented, it is fairly simple.
