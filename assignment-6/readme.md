# Assignment 6 Report
 I chose the fotn for the title to be a cursive font that almost looks like it was writen with a quill. I did this to match the Harry Potter theme, in the movie
 they often write with ink and quills. For my second font i chose a simple open sans to go well with the cursive font used in the titles.

1.System fonts are part of your local device and system and shouldnt only be used for print or logos, because of licensing they shouldnt be used for web.
2. Web Fonts are not required to be hosted on the viewers device. They can be called up from other sources and viewed normally. They could take some time to render in however.
3. Web-Safe Fonts are ones shared by windows and mac users that can be called up and viewed quickly by either operating system.

 The point of having a fallback font is for the case when someone loading your site doesnt have the font used, then it will use the secondary one. These should
 be similar to the original font so it isnt jaring to the viewer and so it still has the same effect.

 The work for this assignment was a review from past classes within the media arts major. Ive studied typography for my photoshop classes and my video production as well.
 It was interesting to learn how to apply typography to a website instead of the other mediums i am already used to. I found it enjoyable and rather easy to apply typography to html.
