# Project 3 report
1.padding is space between inner content of the elements nad the elements themselves,
the margin is the space between elements, and a border is the edge of an element.
2. What i struggled with the most this assignment is learning how to use position for
the elements. I didnt realize how important it was for what i wanted to do and how to do it.
i eventually figured it out and figured how relative positioning could help me acheive the look
i desired.
3. This work cycle for me was the hardest one yet. We combined all the things we had learned so far
into one assignment. I chose a neon green and black color scheme because they clash alot and i love
the two when they are paired together. Also for the typography i chose a handwriten type for my headings
while contrasting it with a simple font for my buttons.
