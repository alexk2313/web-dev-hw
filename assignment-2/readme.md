# Assignment Two

A version Control System is something we can use to record changes in our files to map them. We can recall these changes to recall any changes that we have made back to a later date. An example of this would be if we somehow broke our code but had it working in the past we could just recall the point that it was working and go from there.

My work for this week went rather smoothly. I am already familiar with how atom and github work individually and together. I love these two programs and im excited that i already have some knowledge going into this class.
