# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Nathan Killian
I have decided to take this class because web design and development is a skill that i would really like to have. It is part of the media arts major but i also view it as a skill that i am going to need for my future in the job market. Every time i see a creative, interactive, and interesting webpage i wonder how it was all made.

- I was surpised that the internet was originally created as part of a government project
- What was interesting to me is that the internet is a connection of independently operated networks
