      <h2> Who Am I?</h2>
      <pre>
        My name is Nathan Killian and i am a media arts student at the University
        of Montana. My dream career is to one day be designing and creating
        characters for video games and cartoons.

      <h2> Why? </h2>
      <pre>
        The reasoning behind why i chose this topic is that photoshop is an amazing
        tool the can be used for many things. Healing imperfections within photos
        is just one use that is super easy to learn and can be applied to so many
        different things. I think it is a skill that everyone could learn and one
        that everone could find use for.

      <h2> Learn More </h2>
      <pre>

        need to do is search what you are looking for either into google or into
        youtube! There are so many tutorials out there, that cover almost any topic
        that you can imagine. I will provide an example of a youtube channel.
